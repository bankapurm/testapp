    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This project successfully demonstrated the real-world deployment and management of a web server using the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. Through a systematic setup of Azure Virtual Machines and seamless integration of web services, we explored the powerful capabilities and flexibility Azure offers for modern application development.
    </p>

    <p>
        The deployment process involved creating a secure and scalable hosting environment, uploading a sample web application, and leveraging essential Azure features such as virtual networking, monitoring, automated backups, and security tools. We also implemented version control and CI/CD pipelines via GitHub, highlighting the efficiency of continuous integration and deployment in a cloud-based ecosystem.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Technologies and Services Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)</li>
        <li>Azure App Services</li>
        <li>Azure Monitor</li>
        <li>Azure Storage</li>
        <li>Azure Key Vault</li>
        <li>GitHub for version control and CI/CD</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Benefits and Outcomes</h2>
    <p>
        Throughout the project, we utilized several Azure services that played a crucial role in building a robust, secure, and production-ready infrastructure.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>High Availability:</strong> Ensuring consistent uptime and performance</li>
        <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Utilizing Azure's pay-as-you-go model</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Implementing strong protocols and secure access</li>
        <li><strong>Remote Accessibility:</strong> Facilitating seamless access from anywhere</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Skills Gained</h2>
    <p>
        This hands-on experience significantly enhanced my understanding of cloud computing, particularly in the areas of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS). It also provided practical exposure to managing scalable environments and deploying enterprise-level web solutions.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        This project not only strengthened my technical skills but also affirmed Microsoft Azureâ€™s potential as a powerful, scalable, and secure platform for hosting web applications. The knowledge gained serves as a strong foundation for future cloud projects and professional growth in cloud computing.
